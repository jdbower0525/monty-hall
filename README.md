## MONTY_HALL ##

Monty Hall is a scenario in which 3 doors are opened one at a time, and behind
one of the doors there is a car (considered the prize).  This program simulates
different strategies when the person in the scenario chooses a door, whether
to choose one door and stick with it, or change doors after the first door is
a dud.  

When starting this program, you will be prompted for how many times you want
the scenario to run.  Higher rounds will showcase win percentage, though numbers
too large will cause the program to return input only after a long period of
time.
